                                <p class="card-text">BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that began formation in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The septet—composed of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook co-writes and co-produces much of their own output.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The name BTS was originally an acronym for “Bangtan Sonyeondan,” which translates roughly to “Bulletproof Boy Scouts” in English from the original Korean (방탄소년단), a reference to resilience. But BTS decided to rebrand their name in 2017 to now mean “Beyond the Scene.”</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Hailing from South Korea, BTS is now the biggest boy band in the world, topping charts and setting records as they continue on their musical journey.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">They work closely with UN and have given speeches at the UN General Assembly in 2018 and 2020. They're also apart of 'Love Myself' with UNICEF, an anti-violence campaign.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">After impressing the industry with his work in Korea’s underground rap scene, RM became the first BTS member to be recruited in 2010. RM is the leader of BTS and he played a big part in helping Big Hit form the group that fans get to enjoy today. </p>
                                <p class="card-text">He’s also a low-key genius with an IQ of 148 and taught himself English by watching episodes of Friends. RM is also a writer and producer for the band and has also put out two of his own solo albums titled Mono and RM.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In his spare time, you can find him Namjooning – spending time in nature, riding his bike, and visiting art museums.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">The oldest of the bunch, Jin is nicknamed “worldwide handsome” after he introduced himself as such at a press conference in 2017. While most people probably couldn’t get away with an introduction like that, for Jin it’s fair play since he was actually originally scouted for the band because of his looks. </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Like many men his age, Jin whiles away the hours off-stage playing video games and, according to fellow band member RM, if he were a Friends character he’d probably be Ross... but with much better style.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Jin was originally studying acting and was infamously spotted on the streets by a Big Hit Entertainment staff member. His character is also central to the Bangtan Universe (BU) that has a storyline in the groups MV’s, as well as The Notes book and the Save Me webtoon.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Suga’s place in the band was earned through pure hustle: he began writing songs aged 13, worked part-time in a recording studio during his late teens and is often seen sleeping thanks to late nights in the recording studio.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">He has released solo albums under the stage name Agust D, writes/produces music for BTS. He has till date released 2 mixtapes namely AgustD and D2.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">The group’s star dancer, J-Hope’s prowess on the dance floor had already helped him make a name for himself prior to joining BTS, having already won competitions with his dance troupe Nueron. But don’t think that means he doesn’t take music seriously. Another one of the group’s rappers, J-Hope released a solo mixtape <i>Hope World</i> in 2018, explaining to Time that he “also wanted to put my own story to music and share it with the world”.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">J-Hope is known for being quite silly pretty much wherever he is because he likes to help others laugh and have a good time. If you watch him in interviews, he will most definitely introduce himself as “I’m your hope, you’re my hope, I’m J-Hope.” </p>
                                <p class="card-text"> If you’re new to BTS, he recommends adding the following songs to your playlist first: "No More Dream", "Boy In Luv", "Dope", "Fire", "Save Me", "Blood Sweat & Tears", "Not Today".</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Jimin is perhaps one of the most affectionate members, towards his fellow bandmates and fans. On camera, he’s known for his strong stage presence.Always motivated by fans and wanting to interact with them, Jimin is quite active on their social media. He’s a great source for behind the scenes photos of what they’re all up to as well as live streams on their V Live account.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Recently, Jimin has been getting more into composing music and writing lyrics. He also enjoys traveling and shopping when he has downtime. He recently wrote the bridge for "Dis-ease" a song on their latest album BE</p>
